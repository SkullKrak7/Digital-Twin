# Digital Twin for Industrial Monitoring
### Overview
The Digital Twin for Industrial Monitoring is a virtual system designed to simulate real-time factory operations, integrate AI-driven fault detection, and optimize predictive maintenance in manufacturing environments.

### Features
**Powered Fault Detection** – Uses Random Forest/XGBoost to predict machine failures.
**IoT Data Simulation** – Generates synthetic sensor readings for temperature, vibration, and pressure. 
**Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard** – Built with Dash & Flask for live sensor visualization.
**Database Integration** – Stores and retrieves sensor data using SQLite/MongoDB.
**Scalable API** – REST API for fetching real-time sensor data.
**Industry-Ready Design** – Optimized for Industry 4.0 applications.
